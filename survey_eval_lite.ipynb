        "# About this survey-eval-lite notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a simple example of an automated AI workflow. It's a much-simplified version of [the surveyeval toolkit available here in GitHub](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/survey-eval) designed to run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). This version, self-contained in this single notebook, uses the OpenAI API to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Parse a text-format survey into a series of questions\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Loop through each question to:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Evaluate the question for potential phrasing\n",
        "    2. Evaluate the question for potential bias\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Assemble and output all findings and recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook uses secrets, which you can configure by clicking on the key icon in Google Colab's left sidebar.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use OpenAI directly, configure the `openai_api_key` secret to contain your API key. (Get a key from [the OpenAI API key page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and be sure to fund your platform account with at least $5 to allow GPT-4o model access.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, you can use OpenAI via Microsoft Azure by configuring the following secrets:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `azure_api_key`\n",
        "2. `azure_api_base`\n",
        "3. `azure_api_engine`\n",
        "4. `azure_api_version`\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you can override the default model of `gpt-4o` by setting the `openai_model` secret to your preferred model, and you can optionally add [LangSmith tracing](https://langchain.com/langsmith) by setting the `langsmith_api_key` secret.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your survey text\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will prompt you to upload a survey `.txt` file in plain text format (like [this short excerpt from the DHS](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/survey-eval-lite/blob/main/sample_dhs_questions.txt)). Tips on creating `.txt` versions from other formats:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `.docx`: In Microsoft Word, click _Save as_ and then choose `Plain Text (.txt)` as the format.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `.pdf`: Upload to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and ask it to give you the survey in plain text format, then copy and paste into a `.txt` file.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `.xlsx`: Print a preview to `.pdf` format and then use ChatGPT as in #2 above.\n",
        "\n",
        "While it's certainly possible to read `.pdf` and other formats, it's a fair bit more complicated. For example, see the code and discussion in [the surveyeval toolkit](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/survey-eval)."
